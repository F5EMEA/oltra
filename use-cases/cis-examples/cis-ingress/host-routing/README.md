# Host based routing
In the following example we deploy an Ingress resource that routes based on FQDNs:

- **fqdn1.f5demo.local => app1-svc**
- **fqdn2.f5demo.local => app2-svc**


Eg: host-routing.yml
```yml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
 name: fqdn-based-routing
 annotations:
  virtual-server.f5.com/ip: "10.1.10.50"
  virtual-server.f5.com/balance: "round-robin"
  virtual-server.f5.com/http-port: "80"
spec:
 ingressClassName: f5
 rules:
 - host: fqdn1.f5demo.local
   http:
     paths:
       - path: /
         pathType: Prefix
         backend:
           service:
             name: app1-svc
             port:
               number: 80
 - host: fqdn2.f5demo.local
   http:
     paths:
       - path: /
         pathType: Prefix
         backend:
           service:
             name: app2-svc
             port:
               number: 80

```
Access the terminal on the VS Code.

Change the working directory to `host-routing`.
```
cd ~/oltra/use-cases/cis-examples/cis-ingress/host-routing
```

Create the Ingress resource.
```
kubectl apply -f host-routing.yml
```

Confirm that the Ingress is deployed correctly. Run the describe command to get more information on the ingress.
```
kubectl describe ingress fqdn-based-routing

> Notice that the value of Host is now defined ("fqdn1.f5demo.local" / "fqdn2.f5demo.local").


Try accessing the service with the IP address assigned for the ingress as per the example below. 
```
curl http://10.1.10.50
```

You should see a reset connection as it didnt match the configured Host Header.
`curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer`

Try again with either of the two following options
```
curl http://fqdn1.f5demo.local/ --resolve fqdn1.f5demo.local:80:10.1.10.50
curl http://fqdn2.f5demo.local/ --resolve fqdn2.f5demo.local:80:10.1.10.50
```

In both cases you should see that similar output but from different backend pods (app1 and app2 pods):

```cmd
~/oltra/use-cases/cis-examples/cis-ingress/fanout$ curl http://fqdn2.f5demo.local/ --resolve fqdn2.f5demo.local:80:10.1.10.50

Server address: 10.244.140.66:8080
Server name: app2-78c95bccb5-jvfnr              <======  app2 pods

```

***Clean up the environment (Optional)***
```
kubectl delete -f host-routing.yml
```
