# Example

In this example, we deploy [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/#default-static-install) and a [self-signed certificate issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/selfsigned/#bootstrapping-ca-issuers).
Then, we deploy the NGINX or NGINX Plus Ingress Controller, a simple web application and then configure load balancing for that application using the VirtualServer resource.

## Deploying the Certmanager and the self-signed authority

1. Deploy cert manager and all dependent resources:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.0/cert-manager.yaml
    ```
2. Deploy a self-signed certificate issuer:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f self-signed.yaml
    ```

## Running the Example

## 1. Deploy the Ingress Controller

1. Follow the [installation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installation-with-manifests/) instructions to deploy the Ingress Controller.
   * Set the [`-enable-custom-resources`](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#cmdoption-enable-custom-resources) and [`-enable-cert-manager`](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/configuration/global-configuration/command-line-arguments/#cmdoption-enable-cert-manager) command-line arguments of the Ingress Controller to enable the cert-manager for Virtual Server resources feature.

2. Save the public IP address of the Ingress Controller into a shell variable:
    ```
    $ IC_IP=XXX.YYY.ZZZ.III
    ```
3. Save the HTTPS port of the Ingress Controller into a shell variable:
    ```
    $ IC_HTTPS_PORT=<port number>
    ```

## 2. Deploy the Cafe Application

Create the coffee and the tea deployments and services:
```
$ kubectl create -f cafe.yaml
```

## 3. Configure Load Balancing

1. Create a VirtualServer resource:
    ```
    $ kubectl create -f cafe-virtual-server.yaml
    ```

## 4. Test the Application

1. To access the application, curl the coffee and the tea services. We'll use ```curl```'s --insecure option to turn off certificate verification of our self-signed
certificate and the --resolve option to set the Host header of a request with ```cafe.example.com```

    To get coffee:
    ```
    $ curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$IC_HTTPS_PORT:$IC_IP https://cafe.example.com:$IC_HTTPS_PORT/coffee --insecure
    Server address: 10.12.0.18:80
    Server name: coffee-7586895968-r26zn
    ...
    ```
    If your prefer tea:
    ```
    $ curl --resolve cafe.example.com:$IC_HTTPS_PORT:$IC_IP https://cafe.example.com:$IC_HTTPS_PORT/tea --insecure
    Server address: 10.12.0.19:80
    Server name: tea-7cd44fcb4d-xfw2x
    ...
    ```

***Clean up the environment (Optional)***
```
kubectl delete -f .
```
